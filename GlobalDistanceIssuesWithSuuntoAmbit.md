Computation of global distance on the watch as well as on movescount.com are aligned but are notably below global distance measured by other softwares from the very same track produced by the watch, so it is not a track issue (track itself is rather good).

The underestimate measure which is observed systematically vary from one type of move to another and is especially significant when a move is:
- long
- include sections at a low pace and with strong slope
